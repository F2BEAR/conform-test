# Conform Test

This is a test too check how to use [conform](https://github.com/edmundhung/conform) with [tanstack query](https://github.com/tanstack/query) and Next-JS v14.

The project also uses:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm)
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- [t3-env](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env)

It uses the App Router with RSC, server actions and all that good stuff.

I may or may not do an article about it...
